StopFastRegen
==============

This plugin will block all health regeneration that results from MC's "fast regen" mechanic.

This plugin requires the [Paper Server Implementation](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) version [#693 or higher](https://ci.destroystokyo.com/job/PaperSpigot) in order to run.

You can grant bypasses on a per-player basis by granting them the ```stopfastregen.bypass``` permission node. It is granted to no-one by default.

Knowing how nosy players can be, and also how you may not want to publicize this feature, this plugin will show as ```SFR``` in your plugins list.
